hammer
======

hammer attempts to understand which protocol a client is using.

Once this is working with all versions, or we discover that we'll have to
separate pre-netty and netty versions, this can be included in bravo. With this
available to bravo, the server can move towards allowing connections from
multiple different versioned clients; an early goal that has yet to be
attmpted.
